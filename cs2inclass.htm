    <h2 id="wb"> Why Babson?</h2>
    <p>
        I came to  after a 11-year stint at Boston University School of Management in 2009. 
        My years at Babson College have been fantastic to say the least. I believe this to be a community of 
        students, faculty, and staff that respect each other and actually support each other's growth. 
        I have had a wonderful ten years and I am sure there will be many more such years to come. I 
        teach in the undergraduate program. In Babson, I taught FME (Foundations of Management and 
        Entrepreneurship) until 2013 and taught SME (Sophomore Management Experience) 
        Information Technology and Management since then. I also teach a couple of Advanced Liberal Arts 
        electives: Web Technologies, Advanced Web Development. For the last three years, I taught a course on 
        Agile Methods. I designed a bootcamp course called "Tech-Savvy Entrepreneurs" to introduce students to 
        coding as an entrepreneurial tool. I am currently teaching a new core course in Operations and 
        Information Management in the graduate program

      I love drinking coffee and tea. I love hazelnut flavored coffee and I am so happy that there is now a Starbucks in Babson. 
      I love Dunkin, but, the Starbucks is now so much closer to my office and my class rooms. I am particularly fond of Turkish 
      coffee and tea from India or Sri Lanka. After living in Singapore for two years I have concluded that Green tea has 
      significant health benefits. People that drink it don't often get headaches and cold! So, I have started to drink a lot of 
      Green tea and friends, including Babson students, have helped me stockpile a good supply of Green tea. I also have a 
      collection of spiced tea (masala chai, Tulsi chai and Ginger chai) from India where tea is also called "chai". My favorites 
      are the Darjeeling Tea from India and the Oolong Tea from China. A little known fact - some of the best green tea comes from 
      Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia!!
